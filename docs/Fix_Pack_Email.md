## To Markets – Weekly Fix Pack
Subject: [Action Required] Dentsu Connect Data Quality Fix Pack – {{Market}} – {{Date}}

Dear {{Market}} Team,

Please find attached your **Fix Pack** for this week (generated {{Date}}).  

This file contains all issues detected in your Dentsu Connect plan/budget submissions.  
- **P1/P2 issues** should be actioned immediately.  
- There are two options to fix these issues:
         - Please correct these directly in **Dentsu Connect**, not just in Excel. 
         - If you require assistance to update in Dentsu Connect, please denote corrections in the Excel and send back to us to confirm that you require our support to update in the system.
- Once corrected, these rows will disappear from future Fix Packs and these emails will cease.

Included files:
- `FixPack_Market_{{Market}}_{{Date}}.xlsx` (your specific issues)
- `FixPacks_Summary_{{Date}}.xlsx` (overview across all markets)

If you need guidance, see the **Instructions** tab in your Fix Pack.

Thanks,  
DGS DC Team
